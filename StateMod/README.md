# StateMod #

This folder contains all files needed to run StateMod.
Files are created in one of three ways:

1. Edited in place here with a text editor (for example `ym2015.rsp`).  These files are saved in the repository.
2. Created through automated Data Management Interface (DMI) process, such as running TSTool and StateDMI, in one of the data component folders.  These files are not saved in the repository and must be created by running the DMIs.
3. Interactively created and saved to this folder (e.g., geographic information system or other tool).  These files are saved in the repository but may need additional files to be added to the repository to completely represent the input data.

The method of creation for each file is indicated in parentheses below.  Files that are dynamically created are not saved to the repository.

The files are listed in approximate order of creation in order to ensure that dependencies are handled.

## Control Files ##

The following files control a StateMod run.

* `ym2015.ctl` (text editor) - controlling data for StateMod
* `ym2015.rsp` (text editor) - list of files in a StateMod model run
* `ym2015B.rsp` (text editor) - list of files in StateMod baseline run
* `ym2015H.rsp` (text editor) - list of files in StateMod historical run
* `ym2015H2.rsp` (text editor) - list of files in StateMod historical run

## Stream Network ##

* `ym2015.net` (from Network) - XML-format network compatible with StateDMI and StateMod GUI,
which allows interactive editing, but which must be processed into more basic `ym2015.rin` form needed by StateMod, edited interactively in StateDMI
* `ym2015.rin` (from Network) - StateMod river network file, generated from `ym2015.net`

## Delay Tables (Return Flow Patterns) ##

Delay table data are referenced by diversions to indicate how water that is diverted and applied returns to downstream nodes in the network.

`ym2015.dly` (text editor) - delay table file

## Stream Gage and Stream Estimate Stations ##

Stream stations include historical data and estimated natural flows.

* `ym2015.ris` (from StreamSW) - stream gage stations
* `ym2015.rib` (from StreamSW) - controls proration of streamflow to ungaged locations so that water supply can be allocated
* `ym2015.rih` (from StreamSW) - stream gage historical flow time series, monthly
* `ym2015.xbm` (from StateMod baseflow run) - generated by StateMod baseflow run mode
* `ym2015x.xbm` (from StateMod baseflow run) - ?
* `ym2015x_mod.xbm` (from StateMod baseflow run) - ?

## Consumptive Use Model Files ##

The StateCU model estimates consumptive use in a separate model dataset.  The following files are copied from that dataset to this folder for use in the StateMod model:

* `ym2015.str` (from StateCU model) - consumptive use locations
* `ym2015.ipy` (from StateCU model) - irrigation practice time series, yearly
* `ym2015B.ipy` (from StateCU model) - baseline irrigation practice time series, yearly
* `ym2015.iwr` (from StateCU model) - irrigation water requirement time series, monthly
* `ym2015B.iwr` (from StateCU model) - baseline irrigation water requirement time series, monthly

## Diversions ##

Diversions correspond to structures that divert water to meet demand.  Structures are predominantly for agriculture but also include urban demand.

* `ym2015.dds` (from Diversions) - diversion stations (structures)
* `ym2015.ddr` (from Diversions) - diversion station rights
* `ym2015.ddh` (from Diversions) - historical diversion time series, monthly
* `ym2015B.ddm` (from Diversions) - baseline demand time series, monthly
* `ym2015H.ddm` (from Diversions) - historical demand time series, monthly

## Reservoirs ##

Reservoirs represent surface water storage.

* `ym2015.eva` (text editor) - evaporation time series, monthly
* `ym2015.res` (from Reservoirs) - reservoir stations
* `ym2015B.res` (from Reservoirs) - baseline reservoir stations
* `ym2015.rer` (from Reservoirs) - reservoir rights
* `ym2015B.rer` (from Reservoirs) - baseline reservoir rights
* `ym2015.eom` (from Reservoirs) - end of month reservoir storage, monthly
* `ym2015B.tar` (from Reservoirs) - baseline reservoir target time series, monthly
* `ym2015H.tar` (from Reservoirs) - historical reservoir target time series, monthly
* `ym2015H2.tar` (from Reservoirs) - historical reservoir target time series, monthly

## Instream Flows ##

Instream flow stations represent upper and lower termini for instream flow reach and corresponding water rights.

* `ym2015.ifs` (from Instream) - instream flow stations
* `ym2015.ifr` (from Instream) - instream flow rights
* `ym2015.ifa` (from Instream) - instream flow demand time series, annual values as monthly time series

## Wells ##
Wells in the Yampa dataset are used for municipal water use and are included in the diversion data (?).

## Plans ##

Plans provide information for structural and non-structural features at fine granularity, such as recharge ponds.

* `ym2015.pln` (text editor) - plan stations

## Operational Rights ##

Operational rights (also called operating rules) refer to other data and result in fine-grained control of water allocation.

* `ym2015B.opr` (text editor) - operating rights for baseline run
* `ym2015H.opr` (text editor) - operating rights for historical run
